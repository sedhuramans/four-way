# Quick Start - Multi-Device Testing

## ✅ What Changed?

Your system now uses **DATABASE FIRST** instead of localStorage for multi-device access.

## 🚀 Quick Test (3 Minutes)

### Step 1: Place Order (Device 1 - Phone)
1. Open on phone: https://fourways-international-trading-1.onrender.com
2. Products → Buy Now → Fill form → Upload screenshot → Confirm
3. **Save the Order ID** (e.g., NCI-20250116-XXXX)

### Step 2: Track Order (Device 2 - Laptop)
1. Open on laptop: https://fourways-international-trading-1.onrender.com/track-order.html
2. Enter the Order ID from Step 1
3. Click "Track Order"
4. ✅ **Should find the order** (from database, not localStorage!)

### Step 3: View in Owner Portal (Device 3 - Tablet)
1. Open on tablet: https://fourways-international-trading-1.onrender.com/owner.html
2. Login: admin / 2025
3. Click "Order Management"
4. ✅ **Should see the order** (from database!)

## 🎯 Success = Order visible on ALL devices!

## 📊 Console Check

Open browser console (F12) and look for:

### ✅ Good (Database First):
```
🔍 Searching in database...
✅ Order found in database
```

### ❌ Bad (localStorage First):
```
📱 Searching in localStorage...
```

## 🔧 If Something's Wrong

1. **Clear browser cache**: Ctrl+Shift+Delete
2. **Hard refresh**: Ctrl+F5
3. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for Render deployment
4. **Check Render logs** for errors
